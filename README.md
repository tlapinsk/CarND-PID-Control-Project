# PID Control Project
In this project, I used C++ to write a program that uses PID Control to steer a car around a virtual track. 

## Project Info
For a great YouTube video on PID control, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR0hOmjaHp0)

To see the implementation please visit the following file in the 'src' folder:

1. PID.cpp
2. main.cpp

## Setup instructions
FYI, I ran my code on a Macbook Pro. Please ensure you have downloaded the Udacity SDCND Simulator [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/) and have installed cmake (3.5), make (4.1), and gcc/gcc+ (5.4).

1. Open Terminal
2. `git clone https://github.com/tlapinsk/CarND-PID-Control-Project.git`
3. `cd CarND-PID-Control-Project`
4. `sh install-mac.sh`
5. `mkdir build && cd build`
6. `cmake`
7. `make`
8. `./pid`
9. Run the term2_sim application, select Project 3, and click 'Start'

## Results
In the following video, the car reached as fast as 34 MPH
